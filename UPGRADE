///     This is AfterStep UPGRADE
///

Theme usage changed slightly from shell scipting to perl scripts.  Users
of earlier 1.7.x snapshots should verify that these following files match
those in the share tree:

$HOME/GNUstep/Library/AfterStep/start/Desktop/Theme/.include
$HOME/GNUstep/Library/AfterStep/form

Likewise it is always a good idea to _mv_ your old ~/G/L/A aside and
start with the newly created tree upon your first run of AfterStep.

AfterStep 1.6.x+ - UPGRADE - December 10 1998 - (mihm)

Before installing this release, all previous versions of the binary and
modules should be removed.  A script is included to remove the old binaries,

so locate some files to set the variables, for example:

    ...to get the BIN variable
	# find / -type f -perm +111 -name afterstep
	/usr/bin/afterstep
    ...to get the MAN variable
	# find / -type f -name afterstep | grep man
	/usr/bin/man/man1/afterstep.1
    ...to get the DOC variable
	# find / -type f -name afterstep-1.html
	/usr/share/afterstep/doc/afterstep-1.html

Now edit the /<src-root>/AfterStep-<version>/tools/Uninstall-Old-AfterStep
file and replace the variables at the top with the ones you found, using our
example above:

	BIN=/usr/bin/
	MAN=/usr/bin/man/man1/
	DOC=/usr/share/afterstep/doc/

Save and exit the script and run it:

	/<src-root>/AfterStep-<version>/tools/Uninstall-Old-AfterStep

By default, this script only removes the old man pages, afterstep binary and
modules; leaving the AfterStep apps that were once shipped with the release,
on the disk.  If you'd like to remove all of these as well (understanding
that you'll need to reinstall them after obtaining them from the ftp site),
you can issue the '-all' option.  This script will also mv all the existing
users' ~/GNUstep/Library/AfterStep/ directory tree to a backup copy.  Some
configuration files have been modified in the new release and to ensure
that afterstep will start, these should be moved aside.  After starting,
the old configuration files can be merged with the new configuration files,
as long as close attention is paid when merging them.

In addition to what the script removes, if you have not done any
modifications to the (typically for 1.3.x-1.4.x) /usr/share/afterstep/
directory tree, you can safely remove it. BE CAREFUL! Make sure you aren't
using that directory for your configuration and have forgotten that you
actually DID make a modification in there. :)

A reminder: Always *move* your ~/G/L/A/ tree to a backup before starting a
new version number of AfterStep, e.g 1.4.x to 1.5.x .  NO EXCEPTIONS!
