<P>The rest of this document assumes you are running AfterStep 1.8, there is no more
information pertaining to AfterStep 1.6.  If you are running a version of AfterStep prior
to version 1.8, this document will suggests only one thing: upgrade.

<H2><A NAME="ss1.2">1.2 What is AfterStep?</A>
</H2>

<P>AfterStep is a window manager for the X Window System (hereafter referred to as X).
It was started to emulate the look and feel of NeXTSTEP(tm), but has evolved into
something that while still being able to emulate NeXT, can do much much more.  Without
using much memory or cpu time, AfterStep provides all the features one could want in a
window manager.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.3">1.3 What is AfterStep's history?</A>
</H2>

<P>The following is taken from the AfterStep man page (

<PRE>
       AfterStep  is  a continuation of the BowMan window manager
       which was originally put together by Bo Yang.  BowMan  was
       based  on  the  fvwm  window  manager,  written  by Robert
       Nation.  Fvwm was based on code from twm.  And  so  on....
       It  is  designed  not only to emulate some of the look and
       feel of the NEXTSTEP(tm) user interface, but also  to  add
       useful,  requested,  and neat features.  The changes which
       comprise AfterStep's personality were originally  part  of
       BowMan  development, but due to a desire to move past SIM-
       PLE EMULATION and into a niche as its OWN valuable  window
       manager, the previous designers decided to change the pro-
       ject name and move on.

<H2><A NAME="ss1.4">1.4 Fine, what if I'm not running AfterStep 1.8? Is there a FAQ for me?</A>
</H2>

<P>Yes.  There should be a version of the AfterStep 1.6 FAQ available anywhere this document
is located.  If you are using a version earlier than 1.6, it is strongly suggested you
upgrade.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.5">1.5 What is X? What are these "window managers" ?</A>
</H2>

<P>"X" is shorthand for The X Window System. It is a basis for building graphical user
interfaces for UNIX (it is available for non-UNIX systems, but wasn't designed to be as
such). "X" is not the interface itself, just a foundation for one.  For more information,
check
<A HREF="http://www.x.org">http://www.x.org</A>.
<P>A window manager is a program that manages your windows during your X session. AfterStep
is one of many available
<A HREF="http://www.plig.org/xwinman/">window managers</A>.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.6">1.6 What are AfterStep's main features?</A>
</H2>

<P>
<UL>
<LI> The Wharf.  Similar to NeXTSTEP's(tm) Dock, it allows applications to be Swallowed,
shortcuts with icons, and many other things.</LI>
<LI> The Pager.  Shows a miniature view of the Afterstep desktops, you can move between
them, and move windows around in the Pager as though it were a miniature desktop.</LI>
<LI> The WinList.  A list of all the windows, clicking on the items can show that window,
destroy it, shade it, or anything you might want.</LI>
<LI> NeXTSTEP(tm) like look, feel, icons, and menus.</LI>
<LI> Very configurable.  Almost anything can be changed.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.7">1.7 Is AfterStep 1.8 GNOME and/or KDE compliant?</A>
</H2>

<P>As of version 1.7.59 AfterStep has been GNOME compliant through the Gnome module.  It is
not perfect yet, but near-100% compliance is on the way.
<P>AfterStep works fine with KDE.  It may not be "compliant" per se, but the desktop icons KDE
provides, and most of its other features work with AfterStep almost perfectly.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.8">1.8 Can I run it in Microsoft Windows(tm)?</A>
</H2>

<P>Not unless you get an X server.  Take a look at
<A HREF="http://www.rahul.net/kenton/xsites.html#XMicrosoft">http://www.rahul.net/kenton/xsites.html#XMicrosoft</A> for more information on how to set one up.
<P>Or, you could use an AfterStep like program named "LiteSTEP" to give your Windows 9x
interface an appearance quite similar to AfterStep. You can get more information about
LiteSTEP at
<A HREF="http://www.litestep.net">http://www.litestep.net</A>.  <EM>Note</EM>: please do note send
LiteSTEP related questions to the AfterStep mailing list, the AfterStep developers, or the
maintainers of this FAQ, they <EM>cannot</EM> help you.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.9">1.9 Who develops AfterStep?</A>
</H2>

<P>Many people.  Take a look at
<A HREF="http://www.afterstep.org/Team.shtml">http://www.afterstep.org/Team.shtml</A> for a list of
current developers.  Read the TEAM file distributed with AfterStep for a list of all
contributors.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.10">1.10 AfterStep is awesome! How can I help?</A>
</H2>

<P>Send us money.  Seriously though, if you can help write AfterStep, or feel you can help
the effort elsewhere, do so.  Hang out on irc (#afterstep, efnet), participate on the
mailing lists, suggest ideas, help code, etc etc.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.11">1.11 Who writes this FAQ?</A>
</H2>

<P>The file is maintained by Charlie Schmidt (<CODE>ishamael@themes.org</CODE>), with help from
#afterstep, the developers, the mailing list, and anyone who finds a problem.
<P>The initial version of the FAQ was written by Frank Fejes (<CODE>frank@ssax.com</CODE>) and
Jonathan B. Leffert (<CODE>j-leffert@uchicago.edu</CODE>).  Major additions were made by Kragen
Sittler (<CODE>kragen@tcsi.com</CODE>).  Diego Zamboni (<CODE>zamboni@cs.purdue.edu</CODE>) maintained the
file until Guylhem Aznar (<CODE>guylhem@oeil.qc.ca</CODE>) took over development and the FAQ with
the release of AfterStep 1.4.  Andrew Sullivan (<CODE>asullivan@spring.ca</CODE>) took over the FAQ
after Guylhem left the development of AfterStep to pursue other things (he now runs the
linuxdoc system).  The AfterStep version 1.6 FAQ has major parts written by Tomas Duewiger
(<CODE>td@music-satellite.de</CODE>), Sasha Vasko (<CODE>sasha at aftercode.net</CODE>) and Andrew Ferguson
(<CODE>andrew@owsla.cjb.net</CODE>).
<P>Naturally, the FAQ is prepared in co-operation with the program developers, but any errors
or omissions are now Charlie Schmidt's responsibility, so you should contact him to
compalin.  Please do <EM>not</EM> complain to the AfterStep developers that the FAQ has
problems.  They do not maintain it.  Please note that it is likely to contain several
errors, since the maintainers are only human, and the rapid pace of development often
obsoletes facts quickly.
