Now, the things I still want to do with it.  If you have suggestions, please
send them to me, want to make this as useful as possible.

To do: (in no particular order)
 - Add the following configurable options:
   - WinlistAction <action> <response>
       Add more actions, like press, release, motion, 2x click, slide, etc.,
         instead of just Click<x>
   - WinlistTooLong (wrap|truncate|initials)
       What to do if the names are too long.  (assuming you set MaxWidth)
 - Allow the user to setup what is in the Op's and Detail's menu
 - Possible allow diffent fonts/colors for submenus.
 - Rob mentioned some people would like icons in the list if the window
     if iconified.  I personally like the (), although  I am a but biased.
     Let me know what you think/want, I will try.
 - Place a small 3-D pixmap/bitmap next-to/around the windows that are
     iconified instead of the ().
 - Like to allow resizing of the window and have the buttons match the window
     (ie.  You make it wider you get 2 columns of buttons, etc.)

 - Fix the following:
   - The function saferealloc, based on safemalloc by Rob Nation still doesn't
     work correctly, I left it in the Mallocs.c file but I use the normal
     realloc now.  (Being lazy on this one)
   - Tune WinList to be more efficient  (Low priority, right now)

I am open to, actually I am trolling for, suggestions/improvments/ideas/rags
on this.

Enjoy,
