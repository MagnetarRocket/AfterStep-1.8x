1) New configuration mode


1-1) Directories

Now, everything goes to ~/GNUstep/Library/AfterStep or
/usr/local/share/afterstep !

You can use your old .steprc config file with afterstep -f myoldsteprc,
however, this isn't recommended at all.

New versions of asapps will also put their config. file here in a near
future, like modules currently do.

1-2) AfterStep config. files & colordeph

If your colordepth is 8bpp, files ending by .8bpp will be used, the same for
15/16/24/32bpp : it allows you to have different configuration for color-rich
or color-poor X, different videocards, etc.

1-3) Config. files in this directory

1-3-A) Files you must *not* change

YOU SHOULDN'T NEED TO MODIFY THEESE FILES !!!

1-3-A1) "autoexec" will launch several programs at startup;
however, your desktop configuration when you close AfterStep is saved in
~/GNUstep/Library/AfterStep/.workspace_state (this file is called from autoexec)

1-3-A2) "base.(yourcolordepth)bpp" configures directories where AfterStep, its
modules & its pixmaps are

1-3-A3) "startmenu" is remade everytime you choose "Update startmenu" from the
Quit item in the menu DON'T EDIT IT ! All changes will be lost !

1-3-A4) in "non-configurable" directory, you mustn't change these files.

1-3-A5) DO NOT REMOVE THE Quit OR Desktop DIRECTORIES UNDER THE start/
DIRECTORY!!!! Modifications are fine, but removal of things like the ability to Quit or Update the startmenu will be detrimental.

1-3-A6) DO NOT REMOVE THE looks OR feels DIRECTORIES UNDER
/usr/local/share/afterstep or ~/GNUstep/Library/AfterStep, EVER!!!

1-3-B) Files you can change

1-3-B1) "modulesname" configures modules (like Auto, Wharf, Pager, Audio) :
change it the way you like.

1-3-B2) "start" directory : simply put here or remove files/directories for
the 'Start' menu; for example, creating a file called 'My option' containing
'xedit' will create a 'My option' entry in 'Start' menu, which will lauch
'xedit' when clicked. You can also create subdirectories to create submenus !

All this is read when AfterStep is launch & a temporary "startmenu" file is
created, so don't edit it since all your changes will be lost !

Since 1.4.3, you don't need to end the line by a carriage return, which made
AfterStep complain about the popup lacking an end spec or something.

Since 1.4.5.3, you can add AfterStep command as options with the syntax :
Command "this menu item" Additional parameters

1-3-B3) "backgrounds" directory : put there pictures you'd like to put
in the background, however XPM, JPEG, or PNG !

cp mypicture.[ext] ~/GNUstep/Library/AfterStep/backgrounds

Then, pick "Update startmenu" then select the newly placed entry for your
picture under '(menu)->Desktop->Pictures' to change the
screen background : you must be running the Pager for this to function.

Solid colors can also be put, just copy this example :
~/GNUstep/Library/AfterStep/backgrounds/black.xpm

1-3-B4) "desktop/buttons" directory : you can add your own window buttons here,
and edit a look file to use them.

1-3-B5) "desktop/icons/[16bpp|8bpp|common]" directory : you can add your own
icons here.

1-3-B6) "desktop/sounds" directory : you can add your own sounds here, you will
need to edit the audio configuration file to define which actions will use what sounds.

1-3-B7) "feels/" & "looks/" : see section below


2) New functions

Start menu is opened when you left click in the root window while right
clicking will open a list of all windows opened

2-1) look & feel files

"look" & "feel" files live in "desktop/looks/" & "desktop/feels/"; they define
windows colors & reactions !

If you wish to create your own file, just refer to afterstep man page !

If you want to change AfterStep look without restart it, just select the look
of your choice in '(menu)->Desktop->looks', in 2 seconds all windows will
be redrawn with that look.

If you want to change AfterStep feel (ie the way it reacts), just do the same
with feel files !

NB : You can use diffent look & different feel files on different desktops,
however since this is very CPU hungry, it isn't defined by default !  A
./configure chaange is required during compilation

I tryied this on an Aplha 500 ... well it's just barely usable :-9

2-2) GetHelp

When you want to open a program manpage, just right click on left button !
Help program is defined during ./configure.

2-3) Zap

When you want to change to next window with the less effort possible, just
type Alt-Tab or left click on left button !

2-4) Menu fonctions

To move a windows to another desktop (you can also drag in from the pager), to
resize it (...) just left click on second left button

2-5) Windows opened

To know which windows are opened, just right click on second left button.
You can also focus on a specific window clicking on it in this list !

2-6) Put in foreground / Put in background

Click on the titlebar to do this ; Alt-F11 will put current window on top af
all the others while Alt-F10 will put current window in the backgound of all
the others !

2-7) Iconify/Maximise

Iconifying a window is changing it to a little picture (with or without
background, edit configure.h to change this)

Left clicking/Right clicking on first right button will respectively do this !

2-8) Shade/Stick

Shading a window is hiding it behind its titlebar.
Sticking it is making the window follow you on any screen.

Left clicking/Right clicking on second right button will respectively do this !

2-9) Closing/Killing

Closing a window is ending a program normally.
Killing a window is closing a program which doesn't answer anylonger.

Left clicking/Right clicking on third right button will respectively do this !

2-10) Desktop saving

When you close AfterStep, all the windows still opened are saved in
~/GNUstep/Library/AfterStep/.workspace_state, next time you start, AfterStep
will open them by himself !

Specify ./configure --disable-savewindows if you wish to not have this happen; or don't leave open apps running when exiting AfterStep.

Module Save isn't doing the same : it writes desktop state in ~/.xinitrc
(default for each relauch), so for exemple :

* put 'Module "Save" Save' into
"~/GNUstep/Library/AfterStep/start/Modules/" & select "Update startmenu", now it
is added into startmenu.

* open a clock, a biff, some programs you always want to have & run :
(menu)->Modules->Save

* close all this stuff FIRST, then afterstep & restart : it's back here !

* if you then reclose & restart AF, programs you've written in xinitrc will
also be written in ~/GNUstep/Library/AfterStep/.workspace_state, therefore you
should ONLY USE afterstep default saving rather than Module Save's ugly one !


2-11) Start/Quit/Close this session

This will ask you whether or not you want to close current session.

2-12) asapps

The AfterStep Apps are NOT included !

NB : if you don't compile & install xiterm with XPM support, you won't be able
to run "X terminal (pixmap)" !

NB2: IF YOU WANT TO USE "pppchecker" TO CALL, DON'T FORGET TO CREATE ~/.ppprc ;
AN EXEMPLE IS INCLUDED IN applications/asppp/ppprc

NB3: If you're using bash & xiterm, try :
PS1='(\u@\h:\w)% \[\033]0;\w\007\]'
tcsh fans will use :
set prompt="%{\033]2;%n@%M:%/ - %l\007\033]1;%l@%m\007%}[%T] %B%m%b:%.02 %# "

And watch xiterm titlebar while you change directory ... too neat !
