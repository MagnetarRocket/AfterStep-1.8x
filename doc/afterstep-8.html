<H2><A NAME="s8">8. AfterStep Modules</A></H2>

<P>

<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.1">8.1 What are AfterStep modules?</A>
</H2>

<P>AfterStep modules are programs that work with AfterStep, but aren't required by the 
window manager.  Commonly seen modules are the Wharf, Pager, WinList, and asetroot.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.2">8.2 How can I get multiple Wharfs or Pagers?</A>
</H2>

<P>This procedure is outlined in depth at 
<A HREF="http://www.tigr.net/afterstep/doc/MultiWharf-HOWTO.txt">http://www.tigr.net/afterstep/doc/MultiWharf-HOWTO.txt</A>.  Briefly:
<P>Make a symbolic link from the Wharf binary to a new MyWharf. Edit your "wharf" 
configuration file so that it has *MyWharf tags similar to existing *Wharf tags.
Make sure you edit the "autoexec" file if you want this new MyWharf to start with 
AfterStep. Also be sure to edit the "database" file so that there is a MyWharf Style
exactly like the existing Wharf Style.
<P>You can create multiple Pagers in a similar fashion.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.3">8.3 Why can't I find the man page for Wharf?</A>
</H2>

<P>Spell it "Wharf" not "wharf"
<P>Similarly the "Pager", "WinList" and "afterstep" man pages [the key here is 
capitalization].
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.4">8.4 What is the difference between Wharf and Zharf?</A>
</H2>

<P>The Wharf module can use pixmaps for buttons, the Zharf module can only use text.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.5">8.5 How do I change the Pager's size?</A>
</H2>

<P>There are really two questions here. Do you want to change the number of desks or views? 
Or do you want to change the physical geometry of Pager?
<P>In the "base.xxbpp" file, look at DeskTopSize. This defines the number of columns of 
views by the number of rows (2x2 would give you 4 views in a square).
<P>In the "pager" file, edit the *PagerGeometry tag (standard X geometry).
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.6">8.6 Is it possible for an application to wait for the background to get loaded?</A>
</H2>

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
I put the rt [root tail] command as the last one to be executed 
in autoexec.  So far, so good, it executes last.  But when my background 
is loaded it covers the tailed text, until another message appears in 
the file.  Is it possible for rt to wait for the background to get
loaded?
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>It is possible.  The background is displayed by the asetroot module.  So, you 
should wait for asetroot to start before running any root window/background 
dependent applications (like rt or Eterm).  Add the following line to your 
autoexec file (or check that it's there):
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
Module  "I"     asetroot 0 3
Wait    "I"     asetroot
</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The "Wait" line <EM>must</EM> precede the startup lines for the relevant 
applications (in our example, rt).  By default, the "Wait" line will cause 
AfterStep to wait for asetroot to load all of its backgrounds for all desks.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.7">8.7 How can I get rid of the desk name in my Pager?</A>
</H2>

<P>Set *PagerDecoration NoDeskLabel in the "pager" configuration file.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.8">8.8 How do I start an application on a specific desk or page?</A>
</H2>

<P>This is defined in the "database" configuration file. There are three paramaters one can 
use.
<UL>
<LI>StartsOnDesk desk_number
<P>This one will specify the desk number that applications with this tay will start on.
Don't forget that desks are numbered starting with 0.
</LI>
<LI>VeiwportX x_coord
<P>You can use this one to start an application on a specific page of a desk. The value 
should be the x coordinate of the page, relative to the top-left corner of the desk.
For instance, with a screen size of 1024x768, the argument value would be "1024" in order
to open an application on the second column of pages.
</LI>
<LI>ViewportY y_coord
<P>This does the same thing as ViewportX, but in the Y axis.
</LI>
</UL>
