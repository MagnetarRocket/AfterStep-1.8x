</H2>

<P>Shade is a window feature that many prefer to iconifying.  Instead of minimizing a window
into an icon, it scrolls the window contents up into the titlebar.  It is nice because 
you do not have to define an icon for the window in the "database" file, and many find
it easier to keep track of windows if they still appear in the middle of the screen.

<H2><A NAME="ss10.2">10.2 How do I use Microsoft Windows(tm) TrueType fonts in AfterStep?</A>
</H2>

<P>This isn't really an AfterStep issue, rather an X question.  Download and install a 
TrueType font server, such as 
<A HREF="ftp://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/X11/fonts/">xfstt</A>.  
Many distributions are now shipping with some sort of TrueType font server.  Consult
your documentation to use this feature of your distribution.
