.SH NAME
\fBZharf\fP \- the AfterStep button panel module

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBZharf\fP [\-f \fIconfig_file\fP] [\-v | \--version] [\-h | \--help]
.sp
Although \fBZharf\fP can be run from the command line, it is normally 
spawned by afterstep in the \fIautoexec\fP file, in the following manner:
.nf
.sp
	Module		"I"	Zharf
	Wait		"I"	Zharf
.sp
.fi
\fIWait\fP is used to allow \fBZharf\fP to swallow the apps specified in the
\fIzharf\fP file prior to afterstep starting other apps which use the same
name.
.sp
or from within an afterstep menu file by 'Zharf':
.nf
.sp
% cat "~/GNUstep/Library/AfterStep/start/Modules/Zharf"
	Module "Zharf" Zharf
	MiniPixmap "mini-as.xpm"
.fi

To stop the \fBZharf\fP module, a menu item can be used:
.nf
.sp
% cat "~/GNUstep/Library/AfterStep/start/Modules/Zharf_Stop"
	KillModuleByName "Stop Zharf" Zharf
	MiniPixmap "mini-as.xpm"
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBZharf\fP module is a free floating application loader/button panel
similar to the \fBWharf\fP that can execute programs or "Swallow" running
programs,  but also displays a label under the icon (if specified).
\fBZharf\fP could also be used as simply a text version of \fBWharf\fP.
Folders are not supported.

All mouse buttons are captured to initiate the command specified, however
some swallowed apps might capure certain mouse buttons for its use.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\-f \fIconfig_file\fP"
Use \fIconfig_file\fP instead of the default configuration file.

.IP "\-h | \--help"
Print a usage message and exit successfully.

.IP "\-v | \--version"
Print version information and exit successfully.

.SH INITIALIZATION
During initialization, \fIZharf\fP will search for a configuration file 
which describes the button panel geometry, color, icons, and actions.  
This file will be the one specified by the \fI\-f\fP option (if given).  
Else, the ~/GNUstep/Library/AfterStep/zharf file will be used if it 
exists.  Else, /usr/local/share/afterstep/zharf will be used.

If the \fBZharf\fP executable is linked to another name, ie 'ln -s
\fBZharf\fP \fBOtherZharf\fP', then another module called \fBOtherZharf\fP
can be started, with a completely different set of configurations than
\fBZharf\fP, simply by adding configuration options with the keywords
\fB*OtherZharf\fP.  This way multiple \fBZharf\fP programs can be used. 
Note that the symlinked module can not be called Zharf<something>, as
aftrestep will pressume the standard Zharf binary.

.SH INVOCATION
\fBZharf\fP can be invoked from the \fIautoexec\fP file or from a menu
item as shown in the Synopsis section above.

AfterStep will search through the directories specified in the
\fIModulePath\fP configuration in the \fIbase.#bpp\fP (where # is your
colordepth) to attempt to locate \fBWharf\fP; as well as searching through
the \fIPixmapPath\fP for the pixmaps & \fIIconPath\fP for the bitmaps
supplied in the configuration options.

.SH CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
\fBZharf\fP reads the \fIzharf\fP file when it starts up and looks for
it's configuration options:

.IP "*ZharfGeometry \fIgeometry\fP"
Specifies the \fBZharf\fP window location and/or size. If the size is
not specified, \fBZharf\fP will auto-size itself in a reasonable manner.
The geometry is a standard X11 window geometry specification.

.IP "*ZharfFont \fIfont\fP"
Specifies the font to be used for labeling the buttons.

.IP "*ZharfRows \fIrows\fP"
Specifies the number of rows of buttons to be created. If unspecified,
2 rows will be used.

.IP "*ZharfColumns \fIcolumns\fP"
Specifies the number of \fIcolumns\fP of buttons to be created. If
unspecified, the number of columns will be set to the number of buttons
requested, divided by the number of \fI*ZharfRows rows\fP. If both 
\fI*ZharfRows rows\fP and \fI*ZharfRows columns\fP are specified, but do
not specify as many buttons as are defined, then the users columns
specification will be ignored.

.IP "*ZharfFore \fIcolor\fP"
Specifies the color for button label text and monochrome icons.

.IP "*ZharfBack \fIcolor\fP"
Specifies the color for the buttons.

.IP "*Zharf\fI[(WxH)]\fP \fIlabel icon command\fP"
If the optional \fI(WxH)\fP is specified, then this button will be
\fIW\fP times the normal button width and \fIH\fP times the normal button
height. NOTE: The entire \fBZharf\fP will be resized to \fIW\fP if
vertically priented; or \fIH\fP if vertically oriented.

The \fIlabel\fP field is what appears on the button bar, or below an
\fIicon\fP; if an \fIicon\fP is used. If \fIlabel\fP is "-" then the
button label will not be displayed.

The \fIicon\fP field specifies an X11 bitmap file, XPM, JPEG, or PNG color
icon file to display on the button. This icon will be displayed over the
\fIZharfBackColor\fP and above the \fIlabel\fP.  Transparent icons are
allowed.

The \fIcommand\fP specifies an AfterStep built-in command (as described
in the afterstep man page). If \fIcommand\fP is an AfterStep Exec command,
then the button will remain pushed in until a window whose name or class
matches the qouted portion of the command. This is intended
to provide visual feedback to the user that the action requested will be
performed. If the quoted portion contains no characters, then the
button will pop out immediately.  Note that user can continue pressing the
button, and re-executing the command, even when it looks "pressed in."

.RE
.PP
.RS
The following \fBZharf\fP commands are available:

.IP "Swallow ""\fIwindow-name\fP"" \fIcommand\fP"
Causes \fBZharf\fP to run \fIcommand\fP, capture the first window whose 
name or resource is \fIwindow-name\fP, and display it in the associated 
button. The application window will be shrunk to fit the size of the 
button.

.IP "MaxSwallow ""\fIwindow-name\fP"" \fIcommand\fP"
Like \fISwallow\fP, except the button will be resized to fit the 
application.

.IP "SwallowModule ""\fIwindow-name\fP"" \fIcommand\fP"
Like \fISwallow\fP, except the \fIcommand\fP is an AfterStep module.

.IP "MaxSwallowModule ""\fIwindow-name\fP"" \fIcommand\fP"
Like \fIMaxSwallow\fP, except the \fIcommand\fP is an AfterStep module.

.SH FILES

.IP \fI/usr/local/share/afterstep/zharf\fP
The global configuration file for system wide defaults of all users.

.IP \fI$HOME/GNUstep/Library/AfterStep/zharf\fP
This file should be copied from the \fI/usr/local/share/afterstep/zharf\fP and edited to suit the user's specific requirements.  This file, if exists, will override the system wide default file.

.IP \fI/usr/local/share/afterstep/base.[8|15|16|24|32]bpp\fP
Contains the \fIIconPath\fP & \fIPixmapPath\fP global settings for the
\fBZharf\fP.

.IP \fI$HOME/GNUstep/Library/AfterStep/base.[8|15|16|24|32]bpp\fP
This file should be copied from the\fI/usr/local/share/afterstep/base.[8|15|16|24|32]bpp\fP and edited to suit the user's specific requirements for the \fIIconPath\fP & \fIPixmapPath\fP settings of the \fBWharf\fP.

.SH EXAMPLES
The \fIzharf\fP file shipped contains many examples, refer to the 
\fBCONFIGURATION OPTIONS\fP section above for its configuration options.

To swallow the \fBPager\fP module into the \fBZharf\fP:
.sp
	*Zharf(4x1) - - SwallowModule "Pager" Pager 0 3

This will captures the \fBPager\fP into button that is 4 times the width
of the other buttons. Since "-" is used for the button label and icon, the
\fBPager\fP will be resized to fit into the button's borders.

To have a button with a pixmap:
.sp
	*Zharf Doc AfterStep3.xpm Exec "-" afterstepdoc &

Or with a bitmap and a label:
.sp
	*Zharf Raise Up Raise

The "Up" is an X11 standard bitmap.
